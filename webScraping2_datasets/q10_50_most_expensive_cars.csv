0,De Tomaso P72,Price: $1.3 Million,"The De Tomaso P72 is basically the definition of beautiful. The shapely supercar debuted at the 2019 Goodwood Festival Of Speed with a supercharged Ford V8 boasting 700 horsepower. The P72 marked the return of the DeTomaso brand after nearly 30 years on hiatus, and if you want one, it will cost you at least $1.3 million."
1,Ferrari LaFerrari,Price: $1.4 Million,"At $1.4 million new, the Ferrari LaFerrari is actually one of the most affordable supercars on this list. It’s a bargain compared to the most expensive vehicle here. Debuting in 2013 with 950 hybrid horses (708 kilowatts) and a top speed of around 220 miles per hour (354 kilometers per hour), this is still Ferrari’s fastest and most powerful production model to date. The company built just 499 examples of the coupe between 2013 and 2016."
2,Pagani Huayra,Price: $1.4 Million,"Inarguably one of the prettiest cars on this list, the Pagani Huayra cost a cool $1.4 million when new. Like the LaFerrari, Pagani built the Huayra in extremely limited numbers. The company hand-constructed just 100 units of the coupe between 2012 and 2018, with another 20 versions of the BC model (which makes our list further down) between 2017 and 2019. Powering each and every example was a Mercedes-AMG V12 capable of 720 horsepower (537 kilowatts)."
3,McLaren Elva,Price: $1.7 Million,"The McLaren Elva is one of the latest additions to the British supercar maker’s storied legacy. Even without a proper windshield (though, no option) or roof to rely on, the Elva produces 804 horsepower and 590 pound-feet of torque from its twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V8. Originally McLaren announced just 399 units, but later the company dropped that to an even more scarce 249 examples. Either way, most of you will never get your hands on one – the Elva costs $1.7 million."
4,Czinger 21C,Price: $1.7 Million,"You might not know the name Czinger yet, but this California-based boutique automaker is responsible for the $1.7 million 21C supercar. With 1,250 horsepower on tap thanks to a 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V8, the 21C can rocket to 60 miles per hour in 1.9 seconds and a top speed of around 281 miles per hour."
5,Ferrari Monza,Price: $1.7 Million,"Much like the roof-less McLaren Elva, the Ferrari Monza SP1 and SP2 are all about al fresco motoring. As the name implies, the SP1 is the single-seater option while the SP2 has just enough room for you to bring along a friend. Both cars come powered by the same naturally aspirated 6.5-liter V12 engine capable of 809 horsepower and 530 pound-feet. Unfortunately for US buyers, neither of these models are street legal in the States. But f you have the funds to afford the car’s $1.75 million price tag, getting onto a track probably won’t be an issue anyway."
6,Gordon Murray T.33,Price: $1.7 Million,"The second and slightly more affordable supercar in the new Gordon Murray lineup is the T.33. With 607 horsepower courtesy of a naturally aspirated 3.9-liter V12, the T.33 revs to a ridiculous 10,500 RPM. With a price tag of around $1.7 million at current conversion rates, Gordon Murray automotive promises to sell this car globally, in both right- and left-hand-drive configurations. Too bad it's already sold out."
7,Koenigsegg Gemera,Price: $1.7 Million,"One of two Koenigsegg models on this list, the Gemera is actually the Swedish supercar maker’s first four-seater. But that doesn’t mean it’s some family car. With a twin-turbocharged 2.0-liter engine under the hood and three electric motors, the Gemera has 1,700 horsepower and will hit 60 in just 1.9 seconds. The company only plans to build 300 of them, each one costing at least $1.7 million."
8,Zenvo TSR-S,Price: $1.7 Million,"Hailing from Denmark, the Zenvo TSR-S debuted in 2018 at the Geneva Motor Show as the most extreme option in the supercar startup’s repertoire. Boasting a twin-charged 5.8-liter V8 engine, the TSR-S produces 1,177 horsepower and will hit 62 miles per hour in just 2.8 seconds. Expect to pay at least $1.7 million to get your hands on this powerful and limited supercar."
9,Hennessey Venom F5,Price: $1.8 Million,"The Hennessey Venom GT was a record-breaker, topping out at 265.7 miles per hour in a world record run. But the new F5 plans to beat its predecessor with an estimated top speed of 311 mph, and with that comes a higher price, too. The Venom F5 starts at $1.8 million, according to the company, which makes it just a bit pricier than its $1.2-million predecessor."
10,Bentley Bacalar,Price: $1.9 Million,"With just 12 total units produced, the Bentley Bacalar makes some of the ""limited"" cars on this list look plentiful by comparison. Although the car’s opulent design may be the first thing to grab your attention, the Bacalar is no slouch in terms of performance either. With Bentley’s signature turbocharged 6.0-liter W12 turbocharged engine, this car delivers 650 horsepower and 664 pound-feet. If you have a spare $1.9 million lying around and are considering buying one, you’re already too late – Bentley says that every example is now in customer hands."
11,Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne,Price: $1.9 Million,"To call the Hispano Suiza Carmen Boulogne beautiful would be... a stretch. But this interesting-looking supercar made its US debut at this year's Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance boasting a 1,114-horsepower electric powertrain and a 0-60 time of 2.6 seconds. The Boulogne version pictured here – the lighter and more powerful of the two – costs close to $1.9 million."
12,Bentley Mulliner Batur,Price: $2.0 Million,"The electric onslaught is coming. Bentley says it will be a fully electric automaker by 2030. But before the luxury brand transitions to battery power fully, the Mulliner Batur helps send the iconic W12 engine off in style. With 710 horsepower from that twin-turbocharged engine, the Batur is the most powerful Bentley ever. And since it's limited to just 18 examples globally, the Batur costs a whopping $2.0 million."
13,Deus Vayanne,Price: $2.0 Million,"The Deus Vayanne may not be a household name (yet), but the all-electric hypercar debuted earlier this year with 2,200 horsepower, a 0-60 time of just under 2.0 seconds, and an estimated top speed of 248 miles per hour. Deus plans to build 99 examples of the Vayanne, with the first few examples scheduled to go on sale in 2025."
14,SSC Tuatara,Price: $2.0 Million*,"Although initially cloaked in controversy, SSC did manage to hit 282.9 miles per hour with its Tuatara hypercar, breaking a world record. But not only is the Tuatara one of the fastest vehicles on the planet, it’s also one of the priciest. The cost for all that speed is estimated to be around $2.0 million for the base Tuatara, limited to just 100 units worldwide."
15,Lotus Evija,Price: $2.1 Million,"With a new Emira sports car and an Eletre electric SUV, Lotus is on the brink of a comeback. The automaker plans to roll out a number of new products within the next few years, with part of that strategy including the range-topping Evija. This supercar comes in at a cool $2.1 million and produces nearly 2,000 horsepower via four electric motors. Lotus plans to build just 130 road-going examples of the Evija."
16,Aston Martin Vulcan,Price: $2.3 Million,"As with a few other cars on this list, the Aston Martin Vulcan was a track-only special. The British supercar made its world debut in 2015, powered by a naturally aspirated 7.0-liter V12 that produced 820 horsepower, and limited to just 24 examples worldwide. An even more track-focused AMR Pro model followed, but even the base Vulcan was a pricey commodity, costing about $2.4-million from the factory."
17,Delage D12,Price: $2.3 Million,"You may have heard of Delage before. In the early 1900s, this French automaker was competing on the track with Bugatti and Ferrari. Now Delage is back and with a beautiful new hypercar dubbed the D12. Powered by a 7.6-liter V12 engine, the new D12 produces upwards of 1,010 horsepower and costs a cool $2.3 million."
18,McLaren Speedtail,Price: $2.3 Million,"What would you pay for the fastest production McLaren ever? Well, at least $2.3 million. With 1,035 horsepower courtesy of a gasoline-electric hybrid V8 powertrain, the Speedtail tops out at 250 miles per hour and is able to reach 186 mph in just 12.8 seconds – 2.7 seconds faster than the P1. Unfortunately, if you didn't get your hands on one new in 2020, you'll have to shell out serious cash on the used market. McLaren only built 106 examples."
19,Rimac Nevera,Price: $2.4 Million,"The Rimac Nevera takes the title of most expensive EV with its $2.4 million price tag – but only by a few hundred thousand dollars over the next priciest electric supercar. Packing 1,914 horsepower and 1,740 pound-feet of torque, the Nevera can hit 60 in under 2.0 seconds and will continue on to a top speed of 258 miles per hour. Those lucky enough to order one should see it in their driveway before the end of 2022."
20,Pagani Utopia,Price: $2.5 Million,"First came the Zonda, then the Huayra, and now the Pagani Utopia. With 852 horsepower and an available seven-speed manual gearbox, the Utopia is the most powerful road-going Pagani ever produced and it’s limited to just 99 examples worldwide. The cost for one is a cool $2.5 million."
21,Pininfarina Battista,Price: $2.5 Million,"Aptly named after the company’s founder, Battista Farina, the Pininfarina Battista delivers the kind of performance (and price!) to make its namesake proud. Revealed at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show, the Battista is completely electric, putting out 1,827 horsepower. If a normal supercar’s 0 to 60 time sounds too leisurely for you, the company says that the Battista will take you there in under 2.0 seconds. Pininfarina plans on building 150 examples of the Battista, costing $2.5 million each."
22,Ferrari FXX K Evo,Price: $2.6 Million,"Sure, you could buy a normal LaFerrari (which also makes the list further down), but why settle for a supercar so mundane when you can take home this track-only version instead? Granted, the Ferrari FXX K Evo came out in 2017, and it's well past the point of being sold out. But when it was new, this 1,036-horsepower Ferrari tore up the track with its naturally aspirated V12 and aggressive aerodynamics."
23,Gordon Murray T.50,Price: $2.6 Million,"If the name Gordon Murray sounds familiar, it’s because he's the man behind the design of the iconic McLaren F1. These days, Mr. Murray has his own supercar venture, and the handsome T.50 is the crown jewel of the lineup. At $2.6 million, the T.50 packs a naturally aspirated 4.0-liter V12 that makes 654 horsepower. The car itself weighs a mere 2,174 pounds, and at 392 pounds, the T.50 has the lightest V12 on the road today."
24,Lamborghini Countach,Price: $2.6 Million,"The name Countach may be iconic, but is it worth $2.6 million? That's what Lamborghini hopes you will spend on its new Aventador-based model. Debuting in August of 2021, the Countach LPI 800-4 has a 6.5-liter V12 with a light hybrid assist that gives it a whopping 803 horsepower, allowing for a 60 time of 2.8 seconds and a top speed of more than 220 miles per hour."
25,Mercedes-AMG Project One,Price: $2.7 Million,"Mercedes has promised a production version of the Project One hypercar for quite a while now. The first official announcement was in March of 2017 before the first concept debuted later that same year. But after nearly five years of teasing, it appears as if the Project One will finally hit public roads. And when it does, the hybrid hypercar will have over 1,200 horsepower (895 kilowatts) and a price tag of $2.7 million."
26,Aston Martin Victor,Price: $3.0 Million,"The folks at Aston Martin know a thing or two about exclusive vehicles, and the Victor might be the most exclusive project for the British brand to date. Based on the One-77 platform, the Victor uses parts from several donor Astons including the track project Vulcan and the upcoming Valkyrie. And talking about limited production – the Victor is one-of-one and rumored to cost nearly $3 million."
27,Hennessey Venom F5 Roadster,$3.0 Million,"The same Hennessey Venom F5 hypercar we all know and love, but with less roof. The F5 Roadster has the same twin-turbocharged 6.6-liter V8 as the coupe, producing the same 1,817 horsepower and 1,193 pound-feet of torque. Hennessey estimates a top speed of over 300 miles per hour, but if you want one, it will cost you at least $3.0 million."
28,Koenigsegg Jesko,Price: $3.0 Million,"The Koenigsegg Jesko, apart from being the fastest car the company has made to date, is also the most expensive. At $3.0 million out of the box, the handsome hypercar has 1,600-horsepower courtesy of the brand's ubiquitous twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 engine. Opt for the Absolut model, and the Jesko, in theory, will be able to hit 300 miles per hour."
29,Aston Martin Valkyrie,Price: $3.2 Million,"The upcoming Aston Martin hybrid hypercar hasn’t even hit the market yet, but already the $3.2 million Valkyrie has sold out. For what it’s worth, Aston Martin hasn’t officially released pricing. Estimates suggest the hypercar could go for anywhere between $2.6 and $3.9 million – but $3.2 million seems to be the magic number. Whatever the case, this machine is impressive. Its Cosworth-sourced 6.5-liter V12 produces 1,160 horsepower (865 kilowatts) and 664 pound-feet (900 Newton-meters) of torque, meaning its top speed should be well over 200 miles per hour (321 kilometers per hour). The company will build just 150 examples of the standard Valkyrie, with a limited 25-run AMR model arriving later."
30,W Motors Lykan Hypersport,Price: $3.4 Million,"Dubai-based W Motors shocked the world with its edgy Lykan Hypersport supercar in 2013. With titanium LED headlights housing 420 15-carat diamonds and a holographic display in the center console, it's no surprise it was the third most expensive car ever when new. It falls to number six on our list here, but it's still a wild hypercar with a powerful heart; the twin-turbocharged 3.7-liter six-cylinder engine underhood produces 780 horsepower (581 kilowatts) and 708 (960 Newton-meters) of torque."
31,McLaren Solus,$3.5 Million,"One seat, 829 horsepower, and a top speed of over 200 miles per hour. The new McLaren Solus is about as close as you can get to a Formula 1 car from the factory, powered by a naturally aspirated 5.2-liter V10 engine with a 0-62 mile-per-hour time of just 2.5 seconds. Estimates suggest a McLaren Solus will set you back about $3.5 million."
32,Pagani Huayra Roadster BC,Price: $3.5 Million,"Following Pagani’s past playbook, a roadster version of the ferocious Huayra BC was inevitable. Last year, the company made it official by showing off the Huayra Roadster BC, a topless monster with 800 horsepower (597 kilowatts) and 774 lb-ft of torque (1049 Newton-meters). Somewhat surprisingly, Pagani gave the roadster 50 more horsepower than its coupe sibling, by cranking up its AMG-sourced twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12. In addition to the joy of hearing the glorious engine note without a roof in the way, owners should take comfort in knowing that their car is ultra-rare. Pagani is limiting production to just 40 units, each with a sticker price of $3.5 million."
33,Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport,Price: $3.6 Million,"Another showstopper from the Geneva Motor Show that never was, the Bugatti Chiron Pur Sport is a special edition Chiron with a focus on aerodynamics, weight reduction, and power distribution. It’s the same 8.0-liter quad-turbo W16 engine underneath the skin but it’s now mated to a recalibrated automatic gearbox. While the peak output remains unchanged at 1,500 horsepower (1,103 kilowatts), the rpm redline has been set 200 rpm higher, up to 6,900 rpm. The Pur Sport also features slightly revised bodywork, with a bigger rear wing and more aerodynamic front fascia. Beginning production in late 2020, the Bugatti starts at $3.6 million."
34,Lamborghini Sian,Price: $3.6 million,"In several ways, the Sian represents a bridge to Lamborghini’s future. Though it’s based on the Aventador SVJ, this wild-looking Lambo is the brand’s first production electrified offering. In addition to the SVJ-sourced 6.5-liter V12, the Sian uses a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. Total system output is 819 horsepower (611 kilowatts), which also makes it the most powerful Lamborghini ever. As confirmed by the 63 stuck on either side of the Sian’s wing, Lamborghini will produce just 63 units. And each will cost far more than the Aventador SVJ, carrying a price of $3.6 million."
35,Koenigsegg CC850,Price: $3.7 Million,"The Koenigsegg CC850 was a surprise to be sure, but a welcomed one. Borrowing the twin-turbocharged 5.0-liter V8 from the Jesko, it notches that output up to 1,385 horsepower and 1,022 pound-feet of torque, with a so-called “TWMPAFMPC” transmission that shifts (pun intended) between manual and automatic functions. Of course, all that performance technology will cost you; the CC850 starts at $3.7 million."
36,Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+,Price: $3.9 Million,"Earlier this year, Bugatti captured the collective attention of the automotive world by announcing that it broke the 300 miles per hour barrier with a modified version of the Chiron. The Super Sport 300 + is a road-going version of that car, meant to celebrate the occasion. Limited to just 30 units, the Super Sport 300+ is a beautiful version of the Chiron, with flowing, slippery bodywork and a sweet stripe motif. Despite having hit 304.8 mph on the track with a production vehicle, Bugatti does limit its Chiron 300+ to 273 mph in top speed mode."
37,Lamborghini Veneno,Price: $4.5 Million,"Lamborghini built just 14 examples of the Aventador-based Veneno between 2014 and 2015. Each one cost around $4.5 million, depending on how it was spec'd, and was available in both convertible and coupe configurations. Underhood Lamborghini fitted a more-powerful iteration of the Aventador's 6.5-liter V12, now producing 740 horsepower (552 kilowatts) and 509 pound-feet (609 Newton-meters) of torque, which gave it the ability to sprint to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in a blistering 2.9 seconds. To date, it’s the most expensive new Lamborghini ever."
38,Bugatti Bolide,Price: $4.7 Million,"Produced in extremely limited numbers atop the body of a Chiron, it's no wonder Bugatti's one-of-40 Bolide track car is this pricey. At $4.7 million, the 1,824-horsepower hypercar has more power than the Chiron Super Sport 300+, and more extreme bodywork that allow it to lap tracks like the Nurburgring in record time (in theory). Bugatti says the Bolide would be able to conquer the ‘Ring in record time."
39,Bugatti Mistral,Price: $5.0 Million,"The Bugatti Mistral sends the iconic W16 engine off in style. With 1,577 horsepower and no roof, the Mistral takes the best bits of the Chiron and borrows elements from the Bolide and Divo to create a truly unique roadster. Of course, Bugatti plans to build just 99 examples of the Mistral at the cost of around $5.0 million in the US – and all of them are already accounted for."
40,Pagani Huayra Imola,Price: $5.4 Million,"Even though the new Utopia marks the next big step for Pagani, the Huayra Imola packs nearly as much power with a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 engine producing 827 horsepower and 811 pound-feet of torque. The Huayra Imola is estimated to cost around $5.4 million new, which would make it the second most expensive Pagani of all time."
41,Bugatti Divo,Price: $5.8 Million,"Among Bugatti’s recently debuted vehicles, the Divo is a staff favorite. Though it shares much in common with its cheaper (!) sibling the Chiron, the Divo has a lot going for it to justify the extra money. By adding lighter wheels, a carbon fiber intercooler and removing some sound deadening, Bugatti made the Divo 77 pounds lighter than the Chiron. Though power is unchanged from the Chiron’s 1,500 ponies (1,119 kilowatts), The Divo features a different aerodynamic setup, which makes it 8 seconds quicker around the Nardo test track. Finally, the moment you’ve been waiting for: Bugatti is making 40 examples of the car, each costing $5.8 million."
42,SP Automotive Chaos,Price: $6.4 Million,"SP Automotive (short for Spyros Panopoulos) is a new name in the world of hypercars, but the brand's 2,000-horsepower, $6.4-million, aptly named Chaos has already made an impact. With a twin-turbocharged 4.0-liter V10, the base SP Automotive Chaos is one of the most expensive cars on this list – beating out many Lambos and Bugattis – but there's an even pricier version of this car that costs an eye-watering $14.4 million. That version reportedly packs 3,000 hp."
43,Pagani Codalunga,Price: $7.4 Million,"The long list of pricey (new) Paganis ends with the Codualunga. Inspired by 1960s Italian coachbuilding, the stunning exterior and steampunk-esque interior – while equally stunning – are only part of what makes this Pagani so pricey. Under the hood is a twin-turbocharged 6.0-liter V12 producing 829 horsepower and 809 pound-feet of torque, paired to a seven-speed sequential transmission for a real race-car–like feel. The cost for this one-of-five Pagani is $7.4 million."
44,Mercedes-Maybach Exelero,Price: $8.0 Million,"Like many others before it, the Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero is a one-off. Commissioned by Fulda, a German subsidiary of Goodyear, to test its new tires, the Exlero debuted in 2004. Mercedes built the Exelero on the bones of a Maybach, and gave it the same twin-turbo V12 engine producing 690 horsepower (510 kilowatts) and 752 pound-feet (1,020 Newton-meters) of torque. Top speed is listed at 218 miles per hour (350 kilometers per hour) and adjusted for inflation, the Exelero would cost more than $10 million in today's money."
45,Bugatti Centodieci,Price: $9.0 Million,"Bugatti debuted the Centodieci at last year’s Pebble Beach car week, showing off yet another ultra-rare, super-expensive model to the world. Limited to just 10 – dieci – units, the car is a modern throwback to the Bugatti EB110. At the same time, it’s meant to celebrate Bugatti’s momentous 110-year anniversary. Its unique styling cues won’t make everyone fall in love, but at least you won’t have to worry about seeing another one on the road. Carrying a price just shy of $9 million, the Centodiece is one of the most exclusive cars ever made."
46,Bugatti Chiron Profilée,Price: $10.8 Million,"While it may not look that different from a normal Chiron, the Profilée is quite literally one-of-a-kind. Bugatti built it initially as a test for a limited run of Profilée models, but this Chiron ended up being the only example. Boasting the same 1,476-horsepower quad-turbocharged W16 engine ubiquitous throughout the Chiron range, the Profilée has unique bodywork and a custom spoiler that helps separate it from the rest of the range."
47,Rolls-Royce Sweptail,Price: $12.8 Million,"Rolls-Royce, expectedly, takes two of the top three spots on this list, with the stunning Sweptail one-off from 2017 coming in at number three. With a monumental price tag of $13.0 million, it was, at the time of its debut, the most expensive new car ever. It's been outpriced since then, but the 453-horsepower luxury car is still a jaw-dropper."
48,Bugatti La Voiture Noire,Price: $13.4 Million,"With a price tag of $13.4 million, the one-off Bugatti La Voiture Noire is officially the most expensive new Bugatti ever made. And understandably so. A modern interpretation of Jean Bugatti's personal Type 57 SC Atlantic, the La Voiture Noire uses the same quad-turbocharged 8.0-liter W16 engine as the Chiron, producing 1,479 horsepower. It has six – that's right, six exhaust tips, radical new wheels, an aggressive, bespoke fascia, and a gigantic light-up badge in the rear that spells out the name of the brand. Of course, this one-of-one Bugatti already has a home."
49,Rolls-Royce Boat Tail*,Price: $28.0 Million (est.),"Rolls-Royce is back in the business of coachbuilding with the gorgeous new Boat Tail. A successor to the stunning Sweptail from 2017 – which itself cost a reported $12.8 million – the Boat Tail has a unique two-tone exterior, custom high-end finishes inside, and even a ""hosting suite"" complete with a champagne fridge and built-in sun umbrella. Although Rolls-Royce doesn’t officially announce pricing for one-off builds such as this, rumor has it that the Boat Tail cost a whopping $28.0 million new."
