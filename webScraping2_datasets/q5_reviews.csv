71,5,Mind-blowing purchase,"Absolutely powerful gadget. Loved it’s look! Soo glassy and classy. I would definitely recommend this model of Apple.

74,5,Perfect product!,It’s a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones. If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it’s amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it with...

76,5,Must buy!,"I rate this product 5* as it has got amazing user experience with the best performing A13 bionic processor. The screen responds and graphics rendering is top notch. With casual gaming and internet browsing, the battery lasts for approx. 1 day. Camera is very good. You will fall in love with the portrait mode. You can call me a loyal Apple customer or whatever but I won’t stop praising the products and overall experience. That user experience matters and is worth every penny you pay.

81,5,Highly recommended,"Amazing camera quality as expected, battery also has very good performance. Display, body, and touch experience is the best I’ve ever had. Sound quality of speakers is more than sufficient. Apple is known for it’s customer friendly security services and I can see it how. The A13 processor is the best in its work. So I would definitely recommend it for everyone who are looking for it, just go for it without delay.

86,5,Highly recommended,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.
If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.
Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !"
